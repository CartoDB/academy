## What is this?

The Map Academy is an open source project, which serves as a resource for people creating maps on the web. Being open source means that the content that is here, will be free for everyone to access and build upon.

Although is an initiative of [CartoDB](http://cartodb.com), it is not only a guide to this specific software. While we do think that CartoDB is a great tool to start learning online mapping, it is only one part of a growing network of mapping tools. It is our hope that as the program expands, you will find more and more content that is not related directly with CartoDB, and that will allow you to build your skills as a mapper. This means that at the Map Academy we will start to teach you skills you can use in other technologies such as ESRI, Google Maps, or Mapbox. 

The Map Academy is designed for self-learners, but can also be used in traditional teaching environments. Since it's open source, re-publication, adaptations into product manuals, and any other creative usage of the Map Academy is permitted. When possible, we appreciate attribution to the Map Academy.


## How can I contribute?

Contributing on the Map Academy is easy. The content on the Map Academy is written in the Markdown and is rendered into a full interactive website. This means that you can add any link or even code to your content.

The structure of the website is defined by folders on the "courses" folder. For each course there is a .md file (named with a number and the short name of the course), and a folder which contains the different lessons of the course. The structure of the lessons is defined by headings, which are h2 or h3. 

We highly recommend to use any of the existing courses as a template when preparing a new course and reading the [contributing guide](http://github.com/CartoDB/academy/blob/gh-pages/CONTRIBUTING.md) before starting to work on the content.


## Why should I contribute?

Maps are a very powerful tool for understanding and changing the world. Map users and creators include everyone from big corporations to individuals, international organizations and research institutions. Each day, more and more people sit in front of their computer with  great ideas and the objective of creating a web map. We believe that helping them in the process of learning is key for a better and a more informed world. Through your contributions to the Map Academy, you can help build a body of knowledge to empower mappers - from beginners to experts - around the world. We are sure that you have plenty of ideas and tricks than you can share with the community, so don't be shy. Spread the word!
