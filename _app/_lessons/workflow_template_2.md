# Learn How to Find the Best Location for your Next Store

Learn how to visualize new retail opportunities in New York City by building a real world map application. Use the Builder to analyze Starbucks stores located near busy NYC subways to identify Starbucks locations that receive the most foot traffic, and would be good candidates for promotional marketing campaign.

Analysis options:

- Creating areas of influence
- Filtering points in polygons

## Why analyze your location data?

Understanding how to leverage your location-based intelligence into something that you can visualize enables you to gain key insights about your data that you may have otherwise missed.

[CARTO Builder](https://vimeo.com/173591785) not only enables you to enrich your map visualizations with location-based data, but also comes bundled with a wealth of analysis options to extract hidden insights from your data.

### Real World Challenge: Starbucks is everywhere! Is there anywhere else to expand?

A common business problem is identifying new opportunities in reaching customers by location. This could mean everything from identifying new locations for retail stores to identifying stores that reach the most customers and could be a good target of promotional campaigns or testing of new products. 

### The Solution: Identify areas near the NYC subways

The CARTO Builder, _Create area of influence_ analysis option, allows you to calculate the amount of travel time required by foot or car to reach a certain distance. By applying a _Create area of influence_ analysis to our New York City subway locations, we can identify Starbucks locations located within 100 meters of a NYC subway. This allows us to identify Starbucks locations that potentially receive the greatest foot traffic.

## Show me the data!

Most big retail organizations and major cities have public data available to download. CARTO already got the data and created the basic map to start with. Download the following map by using the CARTO teams' public profile export feature.
