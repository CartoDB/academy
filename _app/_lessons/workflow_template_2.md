# Learn How to Optimize a Marketing Campaign by Targeting High Traffic Stores

Learn how to visualize new retail opportunities in New York City by building a real world map application. Use the Builder to analyze Starbucks stores located near busy NYC subways to identify Starbucks locations that receive the most foot traffic, and would be good candidates for promotional marketing campaign.

Analysis options:

- Creating areas of influence
- Filtering points in polygons

**writer note_csobier:** For this example: "Introduction to the Builder", "Analyzing your Data", Exporting CARTO Maps". This is the right-side navigation pane that Ari showed in her demo. These are not pre-reqs, as the lesson does not force you to go through steps. These can be links to other guides or lessons that might be helpful **before** you begin this use case.

## Why Analyze your Location Data?

Understanding how to leverage your location-based intelligence into something that you can visualize enables you to gain key insights about your data that you may have otherwise missed.

[CARTO Builder](https://vimeo.com/173591785) not only enables you to enrich your map visualizations with location-based data, but also comes bundled with a wealth of analysis options to extract hidden insights from your data.

### Real World Challenge: Which Starbuck Stores Receive the Most Foot Traffic?

A common business problem is identifying new opportunities in reaching customers by location. This could mean everything from identifying new locations for retail stores to identifying stores that reach the most customers and could be a good target of promotional campaigns or testing of new products. 

### The Solution: Identify Starbucks stores located near busy New York City subways

The CARTO Builder, _Create area of influence_ analysis option, allows you to calculate the amount of travel time required by foot or car to reach a certain distance. By applying a _Create area of influence_ analysis to our New York City subway locations, we can identify Starbucks locations located within 100 meters of a NYC subway. This allows us to identify Starbucks locations that potentially receive the greatest foot traffic.
