# JOINs in SQL and PostGIS

Joining data in CARTO is a very common task. Not all joins are equal though, and the one you use is going to depend a lot on your data and what you want to create. Here we are going to walk you through some common `JOIN` methods in CARTO. In each section we will show you how to join the data using SQL on-the-fly and then show you how to write the result of a join into your table.

## Join two tables by a shared value in each row

This is the type of join you perform when you have a value in two tables (say country ISO codes) and you want to match rows from one table to the next (e.g. `iso_code='USA'`) from one table with the same value in a second table (e.g. `iso='USA'`). Column name doesn't matter, just the content!

### table_1

cartodb_id | the_geom | iso_code
--- | --- | ---
1 | Polygon... | USA
2 | Polygon... | BRA
3 | Polygon... | BEL
4 | Polygon... | GAB

### table_2

cartodb_id | iso | population
--- | --- | ---
1 | PBRA | 302
2 | USA | 188
3 | GAB | 99
4 | BEL | 876

The above tables give a good example when you will want to use this method. Say you have some nice polygons for your world borders stored in `table_1`, but you have a CSV with a value you need for your map and you've uploaded it seperately to `table_2`. Here is the join command you would run:

{% highlight sql %}
SELECT table_1.the_geom,table_1.iso_code,table_2.population
FROM table_1, table_2
WHERE table_1.iso_code = table_2.iso
{% endhighlight %}

You'll see, it doesn't matter that the columns in the two tables were different, `iso_code` versus just, `iso`, we still ran the join just fine. You could now use _Merge with dataset_ from the Edit drop-down menu to create a new dataset with this data. Otherwise, we can just write it into the first table. Here's how.

First, create a new column in `table_1` called 'population' and make it of type 'number'. You can do this by clicking the drop down arrow at the top of any column and selecting _Add new column_.

Next, check in `table_2` and be sure that under the population column, the type is `Number`. If it says `String`, just change it. Click `String` and then choose `Number`, and accept the warning. Next run this SQL:

{% highlight sql %}
UPDATE table_1
SET population = table_2.population
FROM table_2
WHERE table_1.iso_code = table_2.iso
{% endhighlight %}

There is another variation that will do the same thing, but sometimes you will find it simpler to write:

{% highlight sql %}
UPDATE table_1 as t1
SET population = (
  SELECT population
  FROM table_2
  WHERE iso = t1.iso_code
  LIMIT 1
)
{% endhighlight %}

In the second exampe we run a subquery, so for each row of `table_1` it runs the query inside the parentheses. You'll notice some neat tricks in the example query. We use `t1` as an alias for `table_1`, so we don't have to write the full name multiple times. We also use `LIMIT` to make sure that the second query only gives back one result per row, otherwise we might get an error if the second table contained multiple values for some countries. Depending on what your data is, it may not be good to add a `LIMIT` because you will want to somehow combine all the resulting rows into one answer. If that is your case, keep reading!


## Join two tables by aggregating the shared values in a second table

This is the case where you have many values in a second table, and you want to get some collection of their values where a shared column match the first table. Here we are talking about examples such as, `SUM`, `AVG`, `MIN`, `MAX`, etc. We will do just like we did above, but in this case we use a function to aggregate all values in the second table.

### table_1

cartodb_id | the_geom | iso_code
--- | --- | ---
1 | Polygon... | USA
2 | Polygon... | BRA
3 | Polygon... | BEL
4 | Polygon... | GAB

### table_2

cartodb_id | iso | day | total
--- | --- | ---
1 | BRA | m | 4
2 | BRA | m | 5
3 | BRA | w | 2
4 | USA | m | 2
5 | USA | f | 1

Here is our new example data. We want to get the sum of all totals in each country. So, the SQL would look like this:

{% highlight sql %}
SELECT
  table_1.the_geom,
  table_1.iso_code,
  SUM(table_2.total) as total
FROM table_1, table_2
WHERE table_1.iso_code = table_2.iso
GROUP BY table_1.iso_code, table_2.iso
{% endhighlight %}

The biggest change now is the use of the `GROUP BY` method. This collapses all rows that have a shared 'iso' value, and then using `SUM` it sums up all the values in total from those collapsed rows! Nice, right? Now, lets add a column to `table_1` called `total` and make it numeric. Now to do the update version of the query:

{% highlight sql %}
UPDATE table_1 as t1
SET total =  (
  SELECT SUM(total)
  FROM table_2
  WHERE iso = t1.iso_code
  GROUP BY iso
)
{% endhighlight %}

Pretty simple. We can do this all day long!

[Here](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.3/static/functions-aggregate.html) are some other types of functions other than `SUM` you might be interested in.


## Join two tables by geospatial intersection!

One of the most exciting joins is done by using geospatial intersections. If you have a set of points in one table, and a set of state polygons with `iso_codes` in a second. You could use a geospatial intersection to give each point an ISO code based on the state they fall in. We can also of course combine `COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`, `MIN`, `MAX` and all that good stuff here too! Here is some example data:

### table_1

cartodb_id | the_geom | iso_code
--- | --- | ---
1 | Polygon... | USA
2 | Polygon... | BRA
3 | Polygon... | BEL
4 | Polygon... | GAB

### table_2

cartodb_id | the_geom
--- | --- | ---
1 | -58.299992, -33.989619
2 | -56.709986, -34.349959
3 | -56.48602, -30.415987
4 | -57.599957, -30.259614

Let's say we just want to know the total number of points from `table_2` that fall in `table_1`. Easy, let's see the SQL:

{% highlight sql %}
SELECT table_1.the_geom,table_1.iso_code,COUNT(*) as count
FROM table_1, table_2
WHERE ST_Intersects(table_1.the_geom, table_2.the_geom)
GROUP BY table_1.the_geom, table_1.iso_code
{% endhighlight %}

The `ST_Intersects` function is one you are going to use again and again. You'll love it. Now, let's do the same but insert the result into a new column. Start by adding a column to `table_1` called `total` and make it numeric. Next, run:

{% highlight sql %}
UPDATE table_1 as t1
SET total =  (
  SELECT COUNT(*)
  FROM table_2
  WHERE ST_Intersects(the_geom, t1.the_geom)
)
{% endhighlight %}

Nifty, right? You can now use this in combination with `SUM`, `AVG`, `MAX` and all that good stuff to get the values you need from one table into the next.


## Join two tables dynamically

Just a note about doing the above for a map you build on Leaflet. You may not always want to write the result into `table_1`, instead, you may want to query data live from the browser based on something the user is doing. In those cases, use the `SELECT` statements. If you are rendering a map with the results, you just need to remember to include `the_geom_webmercator` is all! It is our hidden reprojection of `the_geom` that makes the final map speedy. Here is the above query modified to include it:

{% highlight sql %}
SELECT
  table_1.the_geom,
  table_1.iso_code,
  COUNT(*) as count,
  table_1.the_geom_webmercator
FROM table_1, table_2
WHERE ST_Intersects(table_1.the_geom, table_2.the_geom)
GROUP BY table_1.the_geom, table_1.iso_code
{% endhighlight %}


## Join two real datasets

Now, let's run through an example using a couple real datasets. Start by getting two datasets ready in your CARTO account. To find them, go to your account dashboard. From the Data View, click _Data library_. Search for the dataset called 'World Rivers' and click _Connect dataset_. This will load the data and take you to the resulting table. If you click on _Map view_, you'll see that it is a basic map of some of the worlds large rivers. This comes from [Natural Earth Data](http://naturalearthdata.com). Take note of the name of the table that was created, in our case it was `table_50m_rivers_lake_cen`.

Next, go back to your Dashboard by clicking the _back link_ in the upper left. Repeat the process importing a different table from the _Data library_. This time you have to import 'World Borders' dataset. When the table finishes loading click _Map View_, and you'll see that it is a dataset of all country borders. Let's join the rivers with the countries so we can make a choropleth of the total length of big rivers in countries around the world. Of course, our map is going to ignore all the little rivers not included in our dataset, but this is just an example!

### Joining the data

From inside your country borders table create a new column to hold some numerical data. In the _Data View_, click the drop down arrow beside any regular column name and then click _Add new column_.

<p class="wrap-border"><img src="{{ '/img/course4/lesson3/img1.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" alt="creating column" /></p>

In the options, add `big_rivers` as the column and select `Number` as the type. Finally, click 'Create column'.

### Join through a SELECT statement

Now, let's do a `SELECT` to see the data joined:

{% highlight sql %}
SELECT
  tm_world_borders_s.cartodb_id,
  COUNT(table_50m_rivers_lake_cen.cartodb_id)
FROM tm_world_borders_s, table_50m_rivers_lake_cen
WHERE ST_Intersects(
  tm_world_borders_s.the_geom,
  table_50m_rivers_lake_cen.the_geom)
GROUP BY tm_world_borders_s.cartodb_id
{% endhighlight %}

In the above query, we are counting all the rivers that intersect a country. Be sure that your world borders table is named `tm_world_borders_s`. We `GROUP BY` the country name so that as a result we get country name and a count of big rivers. Great!

### Updating a table using a JOIN

Now lets run a similar query, but write the numeric value to the column we created earlier, `big_rivers`. Run the following:

{% highlight sql %}
UPDATE tm_world_borders_s wb
SET big_rivers = (
  SELECT COUNT(table_50m_rivers_lake_cen.cartodb_id)
  FROM table_50m_rivers_lake_cen
  WHERE ST_Intersects(
    wb.the_geom,
    table_50m_rivers_lake_cen.the_geom
  ))
{% endhighlight %}

In the above query, we are running the `UPDATE` to our new column `big_rivers`, but running a nested query that selects the count of all rivers that intersect it. Like the above examples, we use an alias for the name of our world borders table name, `wb`. You can see that the alias is then used when we run the `ST_Intersects` function, indicating that for every row in the wb table, we count the rivers that intersect the country geometry. We can check now the column shows the number of rivers that each country intersects with:

<p class="wrap-border"><img src="{{ '/img/course4/lesson3/img2.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" alt="number of rivers" /></p>

### Mapping the results

Now, go back to the _Map View_ for your world borders table. Click the _Style option_ on the right hand side of your map. In the sidebar that slides out, click the overview image of the _Choropleth map_. In the menu, for Column select `big_rivers` and customize the look & feel of the map.

<p class="wrap-border"><img src="{{ '/img/course4/lesson3/img3.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" alt="cloropeth" /></p>

Now take a look at the map and you can see which countries the most rivers in our dataset pass through.
