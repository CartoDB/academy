You can export any of your datasets for use offline, regardless of whether or not an analysis was applied. For example, suppose you are a Business Analyst and you want to export an analyzed map layer into Excel for additional reporting. The _Export data_ option enables you to export the map layer as a _CSV_ file. You can also export your data using other image and geospatial formats, such as _SHP, KML, GEO JSON,_ and _SVG_.
