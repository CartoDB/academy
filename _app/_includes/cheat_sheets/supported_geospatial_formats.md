## Supported Geospatial Data Formats

CARTO supports a large number of data types and file formats. For details about the type of data that you can import, see [Supported Geospatial Data Format](https://carto.com/docs/carto-engine/import-api/importing-geospatial-data/#supported-geospatial-data-formats).

**Tip:** It is highly recommended that you compress your files before importing them. CARTO supports .ZIP and .GZ (which includes .TAR.GZ and .TGZ) for compressing and archiving files.

If you are importing a non-supported file type, the import will fail. See [Import Errors](https://carto.com/docs/carto-engine/import-api/import-errors/) for a list of known error codes and solutions.
