## Publishing Rules

In order for your map to appear live, you must publish your map. All maps are "unpublished" by default, regardless of your privacy settings. Once your map is published, a timestamp is captured for your published map. 

If you apply any edits to your map, these changes are **not** updated dynamically. You must continuously update your map. This is intentional by design, allowing the original map builder to control when their maps are updated and shared. Some of the benefits of the publishing feature include:

- Prevents any unwanted edits to your original shared map
- Allows you to visualize and test map styling changes before updating your published maps
- Captures your map at a given published time. Suppose you have a published embedded map, you can delete layers, widgets, and apply other map styling, while keeping your published map intact

These features ensure that your published maps remain stable, and give you complete control over any updates that you wish to share. 

**Note:** The publishing options do not apply to synced datasets. Synced data from published maps will continue to update dynamically.
