## Create Layer from Analysis

Once an analysis is created, you can use the drag and drop functionality to quickly create a new layer based on an analysis, and apply custom styling based on your analysis. This procedure describes how to auto-create a new map layer from an analysis.

- From the LAYERS section of an open map in the Builder, left-click and drag a selected analysis within a map layer

	<span class="wrap-border"><img src="/academy/img/guides/analysis/move_analysis.jpg" alt="Drag analysis" /></span>

	A confirmation message appears.

	<span class="wrap-border"><img src="/academy/img/guides/analysis/new_layer_analylsis.jpg" alt="New layer created" /></span>

	The new layer is added to the DATA section, and your map visualization refreshes.

	In the following example, note how the new layer (C) was created with the chained analysis (C1), and (A1) appears as part of the new map layer to identify where it came from.

- Optionally, apply additional styling to the new map layer to better differentiate the analyzed data

	**Note:** If you applied styling to an analyzed column, that style is transferred to the new layer.
