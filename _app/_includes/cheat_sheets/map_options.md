## Map Options

You can control which components are visible on your map. Click the _Map Options_ button from the CARTO Toolbar to show or hide visible map components for your published map. 

The following map options are available:

Map Option | Description
--- | ---
SEARCH BOX | Displays a search option on the map, enabling the viewer to move the map based on a search location<br/><br/>**Tip:** This function does not search through your dataset, it queries location by CARTO's default location data service providers, which varies, depending on your account plan. [Contact Sales](mailto:sales@carto.com) if you have questions about your location data service providers<br /><br />- Click the magnifying glass and enter a named place<br/><br/><img src="/academy/img/guides/publishing/search_location.jpg" alt="Search by location" /><br /><br />- The map moves to the matched location (based on the service provider), and automatically updates the zoom level accordingly. If there is a direct matched result, it moves to the matched location and displays a marker.<br/><br/>**Note:** Searching by location moves your map. If you want to go back to your previous location, you will have to search for your original location
ZOOM CONTROLS | Enables viewers to zoom in (+), or zoom out (-), of the map. If not enabled, viewers can only see the default level of the map visualization<br /><br />**Note:** To set the default zoom level from an open map in the Builder:<br/><br/>- Increase or decrease to the desired zoom level<br/><br/><img src="/academy/img/guides/publishing/zoom_controls.jpg" alt="Zoom controls" /><br/><br/>- [Update](#updating-a-published-map) your published map. The initial map displays at the default zoom level you specified<br/><br/>**Tip:** There is a zoom box keyboard shortcut to zoom to a targeted area on your map. Press and hold _shift_, while dragging, to display the zoom box selector. The visualization refreshes to the zoomed area<br/><br/><img src="/academy/img/guides/publishing/zoom_box.jpg" alt="Zoom box shortcut" />
