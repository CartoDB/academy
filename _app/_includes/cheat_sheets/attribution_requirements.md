## Attribution Requirements

Regardless of your CARTO account plan, you must include proper attributions whenever you publish or share your map. Attributions represent the data sources used in your map, which may have copyright protections.

**Tip:** Map attributions are specific to the data that you are displaying in your map, it is not related to CARTO branding (which is removable for certain account plans). For more details about the removable brand feature, see [How do I remove the CARTO logo from my map?](https://carto.com/docs/faqs/maps/#how-do-i-remove-the-carto-logo-from-my-map)

There are several methods of defining map attributions.

- Automatic Attributions - When you choose a basemap with the CARTO Builder, map attributions are automatically included

	When you export a map with the CARTO Builder, map attributions are automatically included.

	_**Note:** Do not remove any automatic attributions._

- Dataset Attributions - When you are using third-party data for your maps, you may need to provide attributions about the data sources. To add attributions to a dataset, use the _Edit metadata_ option, which is accessible from the dataset name menu option

**Tip:** For more information about how CARTO defines map attributions, see [Attributions](https://carto.com/attributions/).
