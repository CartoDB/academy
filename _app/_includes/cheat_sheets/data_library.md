## Data Library

The CARTO Data Library, available from your datasets dashboard, provides a list of public data libraries. You can connect to these public datasets and create a map. Examples of data in the Data Library include World Borders, European Countries, Urban Areas, and Populated Places.

- From _Your datasets_ dashboard, click _DATA LIBRARY_ to view a list of all the available datasets

- From a selected public dataset, click *Connect dataset* or *create map* to add it to your dashboard.

    _If a dataset icon is colored red, this indicates that you cannot connect to the dataset since you do not have enough allocated quota to store the data._

**Tip:** When connecting to a dataset from the Data Library, some public datasets contain dynamic updates and enable you to select options for syncing with the connected data.
