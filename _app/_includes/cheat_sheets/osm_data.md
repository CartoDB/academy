## Importing OpenStreetMap Data

OpenStreetMap data contains features that make up our cities, including polygons for neighborhoods and streets, roads, and even lampposts. OpenStreetMap data is contributed by a diverse community, is rich with local knowledge, and frequently updated. 

- OpenStreetMap data can be exported directly from the [OpenStreetMap](http://www.openstreetmap.org/export#map=5/51.509/7.603) website

	**Tip:** OSM data can be quite large, ensure you are zoomed in enough to limit the size of the dataset that you are downloading.

- From the Connect Dataset options, drag and drop, or _Browse_ to upload the downloaded OSM file

	Ensure the file download is one of CARTO's supported geospatial formats.

- Include a link to OpenStreetMap in the _Edit metadata_ options, which is accessible from the dataset name menu option

	**Note:** As part of using OpenStreetMap data, you must give credit to OpenStreetMap, as per their [Copyright and License agreement](http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright). Once your data is uploaded, include the copyright attributes for the OSM data in the dataset metadata _Attributions_ field.
