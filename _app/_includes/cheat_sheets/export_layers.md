## Exporting Select Map Layers

You can export any of your map layers for use offline, regardless of whether or not an analysis was applied. For example, suppose you are a Business Analyst and you want to export an analyzed map layer into Excel for additional reporting. The _Export data_ option enables you to export the map layer as a _CSV_ file. You can also export a selected map layer using other image and geospatial formats, such as _SHP, KML, GEO JSON,_ and _SVG_.

- From a selected map layer from the Builder, click _Export data_ from the layer name context menu

- Select the preferred file format  

    The data is downloaded based on your web browser process. Once your data is downloaded, you can retrieve the data file offline.
