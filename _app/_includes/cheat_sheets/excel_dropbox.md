## Map your Excel Data and Sync it from a Dropbox

The _Connect dataset_ URL option allows you to import a public Dropbox file and apply sync options for managing your data. Suppose you have an Excel file in a Dropbox folder, once a synced dataset is connected, the sync status appears as part of your dataset in CARTO.

- You must enable the Dropbox _Connect to external data sources_ option, available from your account options. There is also a shortcut to connect to Dropbox from the Connect Dataset options

- Once you allow access to your account, you can choose any of your Dropbox files directly through the Connect dataset options

**Note:** Only CSV, and XLS file formats are supported for Dropbox files.

- To keep your connected dataset synced to the Dropbox file, select the frequency of your sync options to every hour, day, week, or month. When the data is updated in your Dropbox location, the synced data automatically updates to show the changes in CARTO
