## How to add a new course

- Add a new ```.md``` file under the courses folder.
- Add a new folder under the ```courses/``` folder where later you will add the course lessons.

## How to add a new lesson to an existing course

- Look for the course folder.
- Add a ```.md``` file within that folder following the current name pattern.
- Be sure you don't create a ```.md``` from scratch. Better if you start duplicating an existing ```.md``` (like [this one](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CartoDB/academy/master/courses/01-beginners-course/lesson-1.md))
