# The Map Academy

## About

The Map Academy is an online resource to learn all things digital maps, data visualization, and geospatial analysis. We'll go on publishing courses to tackle different challenges in online mapping, from introductory courses to advanced ones. It's an open project in which anyone can contribute.

[More about The Map Academy](https://academy.cartodb.com/about/)

The Map Academy website can be found here [academy.cartodb.com](https://academy.cartodb.com/). The Map Academy website is built on top of [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), a simple content management system for static sites.


## Develop

Be sure to look over the [installation guide](INSTALL.md) to verify your environment is prepared to run the website. Once you have verified that your system can run the website, check out the [commands](COMMANDS.md) available to get started.

## Deploy

**DEPLOY HOOKS ARE CURRENTLY DISABLED, ASK FOR CREDENTIALS TO DEPLOY**

New features should be tested locally, then we've set a hook so when pushing (or merging) to the `develop` branch in the repository automatically deploys to http://academy.cartodb-staging.com/ and pushing (or merging) to `master` branch deploys to the production website.
