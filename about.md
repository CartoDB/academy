## What is this?

The Map Academy is an open source project which aims to become a good resource for people that is doing maps on the web. Being Open Source means that the content that is here, will be free for everyone forever.

Although is an initiative of [CartoDB](http://cartodb.com), it is not a guide to this specific software. We do think that CartoDB is an ideal tool to start learning online mapping, you can make maps in seconds and then learn about the wizard behind the curtains as your mapping skills grow. So it is our hope, that as the program expands, you will find more and more content that is not related directly with the product. This means that at the Map Academy we will start to teach you skills you can use in other technologies such as ESRI, Google Maps, or Mapbox. 

The Map Academy is designed for self-learners although the content is also being used in other traditional teaching experiences. Being an open source project means that re-publication, adaptations into product manuals, and any other creative usage is permitted. When you can, we really appreaciate attribution to the Map Academy.

## How can I contribute?

Contributing on the Map Academy is easy. The content on the Map Academy is written in the Markdown and is rendered into a full interactive website. This means that you can add any link or even code to your content.

The structure of the website is defined by folders on the "courses" folder. For each course there is a .md file (named with a number and the short name of the course), and a folder which contains the different lessons of the course. The structure of the lessons is defined by headings, which are h2 or h3. 

We highly recommend to use any of the existing courses as a template when preparing a new course and reading the [contributing guide](http://github.com/CartoDB/academy/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) before starting to work on the content.

## Why should I contribute?

Maps are a very horizontal thing and a very powerful tool for changing the world. From big corporations to individuals, passing by International organizations or research institutions use maps as a powerful tool in their daily day. Each day, more and more people seats in front of the computer with the objective of creating a web map, and we believe that helping them on the process is key for a better and a more informed world.

As all the technology we use in our daily day, we should also open our knowledge and give more and better access to it through tools like the Map Academy.

We are sure that you have plenty of ideas and tricks than you can share with the community, so don't be shy and spread the world.
