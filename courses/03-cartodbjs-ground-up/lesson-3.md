## Modifying SQL and CartoCSS

This is the third lesson in the course _CartoDB.js from the ground up_. While still covering our JavaScript API in more depth, this lesson also relies on a basic understanding of the CartoCSS and SQL languages. We will keep it pretty simple here so you should not have trouble following along. If you would prefer to have a crash course before starting, check out some of the [great documentation](https://www.mapbox.com/tilemill/docs/manual/carto/) and [use cases](https://www.mapbox.com/tilemill/docs/guides/advanced-map-design/) for CartoCSS. For SQL, you can teach yourself in the CartoDB Editor by using our first lesson in the [SQL and PostGIS in CartoDB]({{site.baseurl}}/courses/04-sql-postgis.html) series.

## Basic Interactivity

In the last lesson, we got a small peek at CartoCSS and SQL when we created a layer source object to get information to createLayer:

{% highlight javascript %}
var layerSource = {
        user_name: 'documentation',
        type: 'cartodb',
        sublayers: [{
            sql: "SELECT * FROM africa_adm0", // African countries
            cartocss: '#africa_adm0{polygon-fill:#FF6600;polygon-opacity:0.7;line-color:#FFF;line-width:1;line-opacity:1;}'
        },
        {
            sql: "SELECT * FROM ne_50m_lakes", // Natural and artificial lakes
            cartocss: '#ne_50m_lakes {polygon-fill:#0000FF;}'
        }]
}
{% endhighlight %}

In this lesson, we will be using these powerful languages to boost the expressiveness of our maps.

_SQL_ is a language for posing queries on your data and getting back the data that matches your query. For instance, if you have a database of home prices in different postal codes, one can easily find all homes within a certain price range in a specific postal code. SQL is an acronym for _structured querying language_.

_CartoCSS_ is a language for altering the appearance of the CartoDB data layer on your map. It helps you make your maps beautiful. Look up at the layer source code above, you can see some of the simpler ways of styling data. It was created by [MapBox](https://www.mapbox.com), is [open source](https://github.com/mapbox/carto), and is [lots of fun](http://cartodb.github.io/torque/). 

Using the [CartoDB.js API](http://docs.cartodb.com/cartodb-platform/cartodb-js.html), the main method to change the SQL and CartoCSS after they have been declared is `sublayer.set(sublayerDefinition)`, where `sublayerDefinition` is equivalent to one of the objects in the `sublayers` array declared in `layerSource` above. If you only need to change one of CartoCSS or SQL for a previously created layer, there are some convenient methods:

* `sublayer.setCartoCSS("new CartoCSS styles")`
* `sublayer.setSQL("new SQL")`

If you instead want to retrieve entries from previously created sublayers, you have the following `get...` methods:

* `sublayer.getCartoCSS()`
* `sublayer.getSQL()`

**Our goal with this lesson:**
Add more interactivity to our maps by using CartoDB.js sublayer methods for altering SQL and CartoCSS.

### The Data

We will be using the real-time earthquake data available through USGS' [up-to-date datasets](http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/csv.php). To get a large amount of data, grab the "all earthquakes" link under "Past 30 Days" and import it into your account. As you will be doing this lesson at a different time than when this lesson was written, your data will appear differently than what appears below.

Before working with any data, rename the data table to `earthquakes_cdbjs_lesson3`. Also don't forget to spend some time inspecting the data types and their values. Experimenting with the [filters](http://docs.cartodb.com/cartodb-editor.html#filters) in the right pane is a great way to get to know your data.

The table has about a dozen columns, all of which are [explained here](http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/glossary.php). The ones of interest to us are:

+ time (date format)
+ latitude (number)
+ longitude (number)
+ depth (number) -- depth of the event in kilometers
+ mag (number) -- [magnitude of event](http://earthquake.usgs.gov/learn/glossary/?term=magnitude)
+ place (string) -- description of where the event occurred
+ net (string) -- reporting station whose measurements made it into the data

We will start out with the following layer source. We will be able to update the layer by calling some of the listed methods of the CartoDB.js API.

{% highlight javascript %}
var layerSource = {
    user_name: 'documentation', 
    type: 'cartodb',
    sublayers: [{ 
            sql: "SELECT * FROM earthquakes_cdbjs_lesson3", // Earthquakes from the past 30 days
            cartocss: '#all_day{marker-fill-opacity:0.9;marker-line-color:FFF;marker-line-width: 1.5;marker-line-opacity: 1;marker-placement: point;marker-type: ellipse;marker-width: 10;marker-fill: #FF6600;marker-allow-overlap: true;}' // Simple visualization
        }]
    }
{% endhighlight %}

### CartoCSS
Since we have only point data in our earthquake dataset, we will be focusing on the `marker` type of CartoCSS, but as you can see in the [documentation](https://github.com/mapbox/carto/blob/master/docs/latest.md) it is only one of several elements that can be styled directly on your map.

An easy way to get used to the basics of CartoCSS is by using the [Vizualization Wizard](http://docs.cartodb.com/cartodb-editor.html#wizards) in the CartoDB Editor. It allows you to pick different visualizations to style them differently in the wizard.

Make sure you're in "MAP VIEW" to see your data visualized with _Simple_.  Sticking with _Simple_, click on the [CartoCSS Editor tab](http://docs.cartodb.com/cartodb-editor.html#cartocss) (the one with `CSS`) two below the Wizards tab to see how your data is styled.

![Simple CartoCSS Visualization]({{baseurl.site}}/img/course3/lesson3/cartocss-simple.png)

You should see that the marker fill has an opacity option (`marker-fill-opacity`), the border to the marker (`marker-line-color`) is colored to be white (#FFF is short for #FFFFFF, which is white in [hexadecimal](http://www.web-colors-explained.com/hex.php)), the marker width is set to 10 pixels, the fill is orange (#FF6600), and so on. If you're interested, check out the [CartoCSS docs](https://github.com/mapbox/carto/blob/master/docs/latest.md) for more info about the other options.

### CartoCSS strings in JavaScript

You have several options for using the CartoCSS text in CartoDB.js. As the styling statements can be rather long, you may want to deal with the CartoCSS strings in different ways depending on your coding goals.

One option is to pass it as a string concatenated from separate lines:

{% highlight js %}
var simpleStyle = 
    '#earthquakes_cdbjs_lesson3{' +
        'marker-fill-opacity: 0.9;' + 
        'marker-line-color: #FFF;' + 
        'marker-line-width: 1.5;' + 
        'marker-line-opacity: 1;' + 
        'marker-placement: point;' + 
        'marker-type: ellipse;' + 
        'marker-width: 10;' + 
        'marker-fill: #FF6600;' + 
        'marker-allow-overlap: true;' + 
    '}';
{% endhighlight %}

Another option is to [minify](http://cssminifier.com/) the string--that is, to get rid it of all the white space and newlines. This makes your styles much less readable, but your JavaScript file will be smaller and load a tiny bit faster. This method can be problematic as there are currently no minifiers for CartoCSS, so you have to rely on tools for CSS, which is parsed differently.

{% highlight js %}
var simpleStyle = '#earthquakes_cdbjs_lesson3{marker-fill-opacity:0.9;marker-line-color:#FFF;marker-line-width:1.5;marker-line-opacity:1;marker-placement:point;marker-type:ellipse;marker-width:10;marker-fill:#FF6600;marker-allow-overlap:true;}';
{% endhighlight %}

Because single or double quotes often appear in CartoCSS statements, you should be cautious that every character is part of the string. For instance, the following would produce a parse error:

{% highlight js %}
var cartocss = '#table_name{text-face-name:'DejaVu Sans Book';}'
{% endhighlight %}

The syntax highlighting we use in Academy helps us tell the story: the _DejaVu Sans Book_ portion of the CartoCSS statement is interpreted as a series of variables (grey), not part of the string (green). You could fix it by writing it the following way instead:

{% highlight js %}
var cartocss = "#table_name{text-face-name:'DejaVu Sans Book';}";
{% endhighlight %}

A third option is to create a custom `<style>` type with an `id` that allows you to extract the text. For instance, one could use the following:

{% highlight css %}
<style type="cartocss/text" id="simple">
    /** simple visualization */

    #earthquakes_cdbjs_lesson3{
        marker-fill-opacity: 0.9;
        marker-line-color: #FFF;
        marker-line-width: 1.5;
        marker-line-opacity: 1;
        marker-placement: point;
        marker-type: ellipse;
        marker-width: 10;
        marker-fill: #FF6600;
        marker-allow-overlap: true;
    }
</style>
{% endhighlight %}


{% highlight html %}
<script>
    ...code...

    simpleStyle = $("#simple").text();
    sublayer.setCartoCSS(simpleStyle);

    ...more code...
</script>
{% endhighlight %}

The `<script>` portion of the code pulls the text between the specified style tags (`#simple` in this case) and sets `simpleStyle` equal to it. This option allows you to directly copy and paste the code from the CartoDB Editor without worrying about the errors that can occur from reformatting. Because of it's ease of use and readability, this is the format we will use for this lesson. As with other style tags, we will place this structure in the `<head>` section of the HTML document.

### Conditions in CartoCSS

Now that we know what the _Simple_ visualization looks like in CartoCSS, let's look at other visualizations. Switch to _Choropleth_, select the `mag` column, and choose _Equal Interval_ for Quantification. Now switch to the CartoCSS tab again. 

You can see that in addition to the first data structure, there are additional structures with conditional statements on the `mag` column. The statements style your data based on the conditions in the square brackets. If you switch to select _Bubble_ from the Visualization Wizard, you will see your markers are given conditional sizes similar to the following:

{% highlight css %}
#table_name [mag < 2.0] {
    marker-width: 10;
}
#table_name [mag < 4.0] {
    marker-width: 20;
}
...
{% endhighlight %}

By writing CartoCSS like this, your styles are more dynamic and responsive to your data. It allows you to easily make your own choropleth, category, bubble map, or intensity visualization just as you would with the Visualization Wizard in the CartoDB Editor.

### Maps styled by end user

CartoDB was created with the goal of helping people from all walks of life tell stories with maps and data. Let's say you're contracted by the USGS to create a simple interface to easily communicate earthquake data. We will be working from [this template](https://github.com/CartoDB/academy/blob/master/t/03-cartodbjs-ground-up/lesson-3/CartoDB-js-lesson3-template.html) (follow the link, then copy &amp; paste). Rename it to `cartocss-style.html`

First, we'll define the style for a _Simple visualization_ between custom `<style>` tags as we discussed above. Put the `<style type='cartocss/text' id='...'>CartoCSS Styles</style>` element between the `<head>` tags, below the CSS and JavaScript library inclusions.
    
Next we need to add more styles from the CartoDB Editor. The visualizations that I am recreating are: 

+ Simple with an `id` of `simple`
+ Category by reporting station (`net` column), `id` is `categ-report-sta`
+ Choropleth of earthquakes by magnitude (`mag` column), `id` is `choropleth-magnitude`
+ Size (Bubble visualization) earthquakes by magnitude (`mag` column), `id` is `bubble-magnitude`
+ Size (Bubble) earthquakes by magnitude (`mag` column), choropleth by depth (`depth` column), `id` of `bubble-choropleth`

All of these CartoCSS styles go in their own `<style type='cartocss/text' id='...'>` structure between the `<head>` tags. The only one that requires some direct editing is the last one. This pulls the conditional styles from two different visualizations.


Next, we'll initialize a map like we have done already in [Lesson 2]({{site.baseurl}}/courses/03-cartodbjs-ground-up/lesson-2.html#exploring-callback-functions):

{% highlight js %}
window.onload = function () {

    var tableName = "earthquakes_cdbjs_lesson3";

    // Put layer data into a JS object
    var layerSource = {
            user_name: 'documentation', 
            type: 'cartodb',
            sublayers: [{ 
                sql: "SELECT * FROM " + tableName, // All recorded earthquakes past 30 days
                cartocss: $("#simple").text() // Simple visualization
            }]
        }

    // For storing the sublayer
    var sublayer;

    // Instantiate new map object, place it in 'map' element
    var map_object = new L.Map('map', {
        center: [37.7741154,-122.4437914], // San Francisco
        zoom: 4
    });

    L.tileLayer('http://{s}.basemaps.cartocdn.com/light_nolabels/{z}/{x}/{y}.png', {
        attribution: '&copy; <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright">OpenStreetMap</a> contributors'
    }).addTo(map_object);

    // Add data layer to your map
    cartodb.createLayer(map_object,layerSource)
        .addTo(map_object)
        .done(function(layer) {
            sublayer = layer.getSubLayer(0);
        })
        .error(function(err) {
            console.log("error: " + err);
        });
}
{% endhighlight %}
    
Now that we have our styles, we need to interact with them. Our first step is to create some buttons with the following HTML that is placed immediately after the `<div id='map'></div>` element:

{% highlight html %}
<div id="cartocss" class="layer_selector">
    <p>CartoCSS Selectors</p>
    <ul>
        <li data="categ-report-sta" data-type="cartocss">Categorize earthquakes by reporting station
        </li>
        <li data="choropleth-magnitude" data-type="cartocss">Color earthquakes by magnitude
        </li>
        <li data="bubble-magnitude" data-type="cartocss">Size earthquakes by magnitude
        </li>
        <li data="bubble-choropleth" data-type="cartocss">Size earthquakes by magnitude, color by depth
        </li>
        <li data="simple" data-type="cartocss">Reset CartoCSS
        </li>
    </ul>
</div>
{% endhighlight %}

And finally, we need to connect click events with these buttons. The following code does just the trick:

{% highlight js %}
// Create layer selector
function createSelector(layer) {
    var cartocss = "";
    var $options = $(".layer_selector").find("li");
    $options.click(function(e) {
        var $li = $(e.target);
        var selected = $li.attr('data');

        $options.removeClass('cartocss_selected');
        $li.addClass('cartocss_selected');

        cartocss = $('#'+selected).text();

        layer.setCartoCSS(cartocss);
    });
}
{% endhighlight %}

Place this function after createLayer. This code finds all the `li` elements and stores their reference in the variable `$options`. Once one of the `li` elements is clicked, its reference is stored in `$li`, and its `data` is extracted and placed in the variable `selected`. The style of the buttons is altered, and then the CartoCSS text is retrieved from the `<style>` structures you previously created. Finally, the layer is told to change is appearance once the `setCartoCSS()` method is applied to it.
    
The last piece is putting a call to `createSelector(sublayer);` right after `sublayer` is set equal to `layer.getSubLayer(0);` within `.done()`.

Check out a live version [here]({{site.baseurl}}/t/03-cartodbjs-ground-up/lesson-3/cartocss-style.html) or the source code [here](https://github.com/CartoDB/academy/blob/master/t/03-cartodbjs-ground-up/lesson-3/cartocss-style.html). There is also a version that uses [minified strings]({{site.baseurl}}/t/03-cartodbjs-ground-up/lesson-3/cartocss-string.html) if you prefer that method. And look [here](http://jsfiddle.net/gh/get/library/pure/CartoDB/academy/tree/master/t/03-cartodbjs-ground-up/lesson-3/jsfiddle_demo_cartocss) for a jsFiddle.

### Basic SQL queries
Let's do a few simple queries in the CartoDB Editor, and then work in JavaScript to extend our application with some of the more interesting queries. Copy your previous file to a new one called `cartocss-and-sql.html`.

Going back to the CartoDB Editor in your browser, try experimenting with some SQL statements in the SQL editor in the right pane. Note that `SELECT * FROM earthquakes_cdbjs_lesson3` just gives you all the rows and columns of your data.

We will be passing the following SQL statements to our method `sublayer.setSQL("...")`:

+ Events of magnitude greater than or equal to 5.0: <br />`SELECT * FROM earthquakes_cdbjs_lesson3 WHERE mag >= 5.0`
+ Events that are not earthquakes: <br />`SELECT * FROM earthquakes_cdbjs_lesson3 WHERE type != 'earthquake'`
+ Events that have a place referencing Papua New Guinea: <br />`SELECT * FROM earthquakes_cdbjs_lesson3 WHERE place ILIKE '%papua new guinea%'`

We can code these into some HTML, grab them with a little JavaScript, and pass them to `setSQL()` to change the display of our map.

First we need to write the HTML. Put this statement below the CartoCSS structure:
{% highlight html %}
<div id="sql" class="layer_selector">
    <p>SQL Selectors</p>
    <ul>
        <li data=" WHERE mag > 5.0" data-type="sql">Show magnitude >= 5.0
        </li>
        <li data=" WHERE type != 'earthquake'" data-type="sql">Show non-earthquakes
        </li>
        <li data=" WHERE place ILIKE '%papua new guinea%'" data-type="sql">Show events near Papua New Guinea
        </li>
        <li data="" data-type="sql">Reset SQL</li>
    </ul>
</div>
{% endhighlight %}

We now need a function that, once an `li` is clicked on, the respective WHERE clause stored in `data` will be appended to a `SELECT * FROM earthquakes_cdbjs_lesson3` to produce the query we want. Note that the last `li` will just reproduce the default select all rows and columns statement once clicked on.

Next we need to change our `createSelector` function so that it interacts with the new SQL portion.

{% highlight js %}
function createSelector(layer) {
    var condition = ""; // SQL or CartoCSS string
    var $options = $(".layer_selector").find("li");
    $options.click(function(e) {
        var $li = $(e.target);
        var selected = $li.attr('data');
        var type = $li.data('type'); // 'sql' or 'cartocss'

        if (type === "cartocss") { // if a CartoCSS selector is chosen, set the style
            $options.removeClass('cartocss_selected');
            if (selected !== "simple") {
                $li.addClass('cartocss_selected');                            
            }
            condition = $('#'+selected).text();
            layer.setCartoCSS(condition);
        } else { // if a SQL selector is chosen, re-query the data
            $options.removeClass('sql_selected');
            if (selected !== "") {
                $li.addClass('sql_selected');
            }
            layer.setSQL("SELECT * FROM " + tableName + selected);
        }
    });
}
{% endhighlight %}

That's it! If you're having trouble getting yours to work, check out the source code [here](https://github.com/CartoDB/academy/blob/master/t/03-cartodbjs-ground-up/lesson-3/cartocss-and-sql.html), or a live version [here]({{site.baseurl}}/t/03-cartodbjs-ground-up/lesson-3/cartocss-and-sql.html)

_Pro tip:_ If you want to take your map to a different location based on coordinates and zoom, you can call `map_object.setView([lat,lon],zoom)` method from the [Leaflet.js library](http://leafletjs.com/). In our case, if you want the map to go to Papua New Guinea after a user clicks on that option, you could grab the latitude and longitude from [here](http://tools.wmflabs.org/geohack/geohack.php?pagename=Papua_New_Guinea&params=9_30_S_147_07_E_type:country), and then add an `if` statement like this:

{% highlight js %}
if (selected.indexOf('guinea') !== -1) {
    map_object.setView([-9.5, 147.116667],6);
}
{% endhighlight %}

The `string.indexOf('substring')` method returns the index of the string where the substring occurs. If no substring is found, -1 is returned.
